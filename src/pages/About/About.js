           Hi, My name is Tamal Mallick. I am 23 years old.Present, I am a student
            of Computer Science and Engineering at Islamic University
            Bangaldesh. I chose that field of study because Iâ€™ve always been
            interested in programming and logic, and a couple of family members
            told me it leads to great career options, too.I would like to have a
            good career in an international company, and grow both personally
            and professionally. My goal is to become an excellent Web
            Developer.I will try to fill up my goal. I will try to learn new
            things regular and try to do practice more and more
          </p>
